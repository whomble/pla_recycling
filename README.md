# pla_recycling
A simple and cheap way to re-purpose scrap PLA from 3D printer
If you have a fdm 3D printer you're probably wondering what to do with all your failled prints and PLA scraps.
The commun idea is to recycle the material to make new filaments spools, in industry it can be a good solution but for a maker the setup is quite expensive. 
Even if the extruder can be made with a budget of 60€ or maybe less the grinder need to be made of steel so less afordable for a lot of makers.

My solution is not recycling but repurposing, I basically melt all my PLA in the oven and mold it in a rectangle shape which can be cutted with my CNC.
This isn't as usefull as new filament but it is 20 times faster and easier and the result is guaranted!

The overall cost of the project can change depending of your supply between 10 and 50€!
